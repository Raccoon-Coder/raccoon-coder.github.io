Here I tell about changes to the site, as well as things about my life.</p></div><div class="blogs"><div class="description"><h4>Halloween</h4><p>Boo! It's the spooky time of the year, Halloween! This blog is a bit late, as Halloween was on Wednesday, but I decided to make a blog anyway. I didn't do anything Halloween related stuff for this website this year, except this blog (sorry), but I will try to do something for other traditions/holidays like Christmas. It most likely won't be anything big, mostly decoration. I will tell the reasons for why this blog is late in the next blog coming farely soon. Bye and have a horrifying Halloween!</p><h6>1.11.2018</h6></div><div class="description"><h4>My Goals</h4><p>In this blog I will talk about my goals for coding, not about my life. So in my fourth blog I said that I would try to make three blogs a month, but I obviously haven't done that, as it would be kind of hard to get that many ideas for blogs. So instead I decided I would be posting at least one blog a month, because that way I can stay sort of consistent. And lastly, I will try to make the calculator before the next summer vacation. That is all for now. Bye!</p><h6>26.9.2018</h6></div><div class="description"><h4>The Start of School</h4><p>So a few weeks ago my school started. I went to junior high school, so I was in a new school with new teachers, new classmates, new subjects and so on. In my opinion it hasn't been that hard yet. I have not been coding much, and don't know when I will, but I will get to it eventually. So far my school has been quite nice and the teachers are great. This was just a quick blog to say how I'm doing, if you are at school, then good luck, and study hard. Bye!</p><h6>31.8.2018</h6></div><div class="description"><h4>My Summer</h4><p>I haven't been coding much lately, because I've been enjoying other things more. I have been drawing a lot and playing a lot. Me and my family are also going to Paris mid-July. I do still have a few coding ideas, one being a calculator and the other being an endless runner. I will probably do the calculator first, as it is a lot easier. Have a nice Summer!</p><h6>28.6.2018</h6></div><div class="description"><h4>My Hobbies</h4><p>In case you are wondering what I like doing in my freetime, this is the blog for you. My main hobbies are playing football, playing videogames, reading, drawing, and of course, coding. I am now going to talk about each subject. So, I like playing football alone and/or with friends. I am obsessed with footballs and touch one almost everyday, even though i'm not that good at football. I love almost all videogames, and I would say I am pretty good at them, since I have played them for about 10 years. I actually learned most of my english from games, and they are the main reason to why I am good at english. I play games almost every day. I also love reading. My favorite book is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I read the entire series first in Finnish, and then started to read it in English (currenly at the fifth one). I also love drawing. I got a set of 74 Prismacolor Premier colored pencils on my birthday and I love them. I recommend them because they are not that expensive and the wax inside is really smooth and great for blending. People have been having problems with breakage, but I have not seen any problems yet. And lastly, coding. I love coding, and I should definitely code more. I will code a lot more when my Summer vacation starts, and will try to keep making 2-3 blogs a month. Anyway, if you read all of that and liked it, then thank you. It really means a lot to me, even if not many people visit my website. Thank you for reading and have a nice day. Bye!</p><h6>10.5.2018</h6></div><div class="description"><h4>My Birthday</h4><p>Today, on the 26th of April, it is my birthday! Hurray! So, I was supposed to publish The Snake Game today, but because of school (read the previous blog), I had to publish it earlier. I might not make anything in a while except for some blogs, minor changes and fixes due to not being as motivated/a lack of ideas, but I do have an idea for a small game. That idea might change of course, but I believe it will, for the most part, stay the same. I won't tell the idea yet, but I might mention it in a future blog. Anyway, my birthday is going to be awesome, and I hope yours will be too, whenever it is. See you later!</p><h6>26.4.2018</h6></div><div class="description"><h4>Pyth the Python (The Snake Game)</h4><p>I published The Snake Game! I was supposed to publish it later, but I want to show it in a graphical coding class at school (not to brag or anything). I might make some changes to it later, such as a menu, settings, over-all changes etc. Also thanks to my brother who helped a bunch when I was stuck. So if you want to play The Snake Game and meet Pyth the Python, click <a href="/games/snake-game">here</a>. Have fun!</p><h6>17.4.2018</h6></div><div class="description"><h4>My First Blog</h4><p>Welcome to my first blog! I have not done this before, so my first few blogs won't probably be that good. I will be making about one or two blogs a month (at least at the start). I have started learning the basics of Javasript and will make my first game: "The Snake Game!" It should be ready in either April or May, but no promises. My first games will be very basic, since I am still a Jimmy (new developer). For the time being I don't have my own server, so I have to add all of this text directly into the html file. That makes things a little bit harder, so I might consider changing to a different server at some point in the future. I look forward to the upcoming year, and I hope you do as well. Bye!</p><h6>8.4.2018</h6></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div>Â© Raccoon Coder 2018 <a href="https://github.com/Raccoon-Coder/raccoon-coder.github.io" target="_blank"><img src="/images/github-logo.png"></a></div></footer></body></html>

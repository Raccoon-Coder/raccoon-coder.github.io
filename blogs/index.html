                    <h4>My first blog</h4>
                    <p>Welcome to my first blog! I have not done this before, so my first few blogs won't probably be that good.
                        I will be making about one or two blogs a month (at least at the start).
                        I have started learning the basics of Javasript and will make my first game: "The Snake Game!" It should be ready in either April or May, but no promises.
                        My first games will be very basic, since I am still a Jimmy (new developer). For the time being I don't have my own server, so I have to add all of this text directly into the html file. That makes things a little bit harder, so I might consider changing to a different server at some point in the future.
                        I look forward to the upcoming year, and I hope you do as well. Bye!
                    </p>

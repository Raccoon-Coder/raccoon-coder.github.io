        <h4>Christmas</h4>
        <p>It's the most, wonderful time, of the year. It's December! Christmas is just behind the corner, so I decided to decorate my website a bit.
            Don't worry, it's just for this month, and I might even make some more changes to the colors. After Christmas everything will be back just like before. Have a jolly month!</p>

        <h4>Changes & Stuff</h4>
        <p>In this blog I will cover the following things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why the previous blog was late</li>
            <li>Changes to the website</li>
            <li>Future plans</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3><bold>Why the previous blog was late</bold></h3>
        <p>So about five days ago I got a new laptop. It's not a gaming laptop or anything, but it is pretty decent and I have liked it a lot so far.
            It is much faster and nicer to use. On my old computer when I was writing something, the letters sometimes appeared on the screen two seconds after I had pressed the button.
            That obviously made writing a lot slower, as I couldn't always immediately see what I was writing. Even opening a browser sometimes took over five minutes, which made using the computer really inconvenient.
            Now that I have a new laptop however, everything is working well. On Halloween I was still setting up the computer, so I couldn't make a blog in time.
            I have been enjoying coding again because of the new laptop, which is why I have been doing some changes to the website.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><bold>Changes to the website</bold></h3>
        <p>As you may have noticed, there have been some visual changes to the website. I changed some header fonts and paragraph fonts to make the website look more fresh and appealing.
            I also changed the game-boxes (or whatever they are called) longer/wider so that it looks better. It also has enough space to fit a brief description of the game, which is quite nice.
            I didn't update the picture/thumbnail of the Snake Game yet, but will do it eventually as it looks bad. I also made the website up to date and fixed some typos.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><bold>Future plans</bold></h3>
        <p>For a couple of weeks/months I plan on only practicing coding and making some visual changes to the website.
            I will try to do the calculator before summer, as I said in my seventh blog. I have at least five tests/exams this month so I will have to read quite a lot.
            This is my longest and, in my opinion, the best blog I have done so far. With that being said, see you in the next one.</p>

        <h4>Halloween</h4>
        <p>Boo! It's the spooky time of the year, Halloween! This blog is a bit late, as Halloween was on Wednesday, but I decided to make a blog anyway.
            I didn't do anything Halloween related stuff for this website this year, except this blog (sorry), but I will try to do something for other traditions/holidays like Christmas.
            It most likely won't be anything big, mostly decoration. I will tell the reasons for why this blog is late in the next blog coming farely soon. Bye and have a horrifying Halloween!</p>

        <h4>My Goals</h4>
        <p>In this blog I will talk about my goals for coding, not about my life. So in my fourth blog I said that I would try to make three blogs a month, but I obviously haven't done that, as it would be kind of hard to get that many ideas for blogs.
            So instead I decided I would be posting at least one blog a month, because that way I can stay sort of consistent. And lastly, I will try to make the calculator before the next summer vacation. That is all for now. Bye!</p>

        <h4>The Start of School</h4>
        <p>So a few weeks ago my school started. I went to junior high school, so I was in a new school with new teachers, new classmates, new subjects and so on.
            In my opinion it hasn't been that hard yet. I have not been coding much, and don't know when I will, but I will get to it eventually.
            So far my school has been quite nice and the teachers are great. This was just a quick blog to say how I'm doing, if you are at school, then good luck, and study hard. Bye!

        <h4>My Summer</h4>
        <p>I haven't been coding much lately, because I've been enjoying other things more. I have been drawing a lot and playing a lot.
            Me and my family are also going to Paris mid-July. I do still have a few coding ideas, one being a calculator and the other being an endless runner.
            I will probably do the calculator first, as it is a lot easier. Have a nice Summer!

        <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
        <p>In case you are wondering what I like doing in my freetime, this is the blog for you.
            My main hobbies are playing football, playing videogames, reading, drawing, and of course, coding. I am now going to talk about each subject.
            So, I like playing football alone and/or with friends. I am obsessed with footballs and touch one almost everyday, even though i'm not that good at football. I love almost all videogames, and I would say I am pretty good at them, since I have played them for about 10 years.
            I actually learned most of my english from games, and they are the main reason to why I am good at english. I play games almost every day. I also love reading. My favorite book is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
            I read the entire series first in Finnish, and then started to read it in English (currenly at the fifth one). I also love drawing. I got a set of 74 Prismacolor Premier colored pencils on my birthday and I love them.
            I recommend them because they are not that expensive and the wax inside is really smooth and great for blending. People have been having problems with breakage, but I have not seen any problems yet. And lastly, coding. I love coding, and I should definitely code more.
            I will code a lot more when my Summer vacation starts, and will try to keep making 2-3 blogs a month. Anyway, if you read all of that and liked it, then thank you. It really means a lot to me, even if not many people visit my website. Thank you for reading and have a nice day. Bye!

        <h4>My Birthday</h4>
        <p>Today, on the 26th of April, it is my birthday! Hurray! So, I was supposed to publish The Snake Game today, but because of school (read the previous blog), I had to publish it earlier.
            I might not make anything in a while except for some blogs, minor changes and fixes due to not being as motivated/a lack of ideas, but I do have an idea for a small game.
            That idea might change of course, but I believe it will, for the most part, stay the same. I won't tell the idea yet, but I might mention it in a future blog.
            Anyway, my birthday is going to be awesome, and I hope yours will be too, whenever it is. See you later!

        <h4>Pyth the Python (The Snake Game)</h4>
        <p>I published The Snake Game! I was supposed to publish it later, but I want to show it in a graphical coding class at school (not to brag or anything). 
            I might make some changes to it later, such as a menu, settings, over-all changes etc. Also thanks to my brother who helped a bunch when I was stuck. So if you want to play The Snake Game and meet Pyth the Python, click <a href="/games/snake-game">here</a>. Have fun!</p>

        <h4>My First Blog</h4>
        <p>Welcome to my first blog! I have not done this before, so my first few blogs won't probably be that good.
            I will be making about one or two blogs a month (at least at the start).
            I have started learning the basics of Javascript and will make my first game: "The Snake Game!" It should be ready in either April or May, but no promises.
            My first games will be very basic, since I am still a Jimmy (new developer). For the time being I don't have my own server, so I have to add all of this text directly into the html file. That makes things a little bit harder, so I might consider changing to a different server at some point in the future.
            I look forward to the upcoming year, and I hope you do as well. Bye!

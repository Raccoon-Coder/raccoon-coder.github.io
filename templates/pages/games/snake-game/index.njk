    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Move with arrow keys or WASD and try to eat the food. Every time you eat food, your score will increase and
      the snake will get bigger and faster. You can <strong> <em> not </em> </strong> turn the opposite way
      instantly with one turn. If you try to eat yourself or hit the border, the snake will die. Have fun and try
      to beat my highscore!
